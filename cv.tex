\defsection{Research Interests}
\begin{Research Interests}
\begin{itemize}
\item Multiobjective and combinatorial optimization using metaheuristics. In
  particular, I am interested in understanding the structure of multiobjective
  search spaces and leveraging this information to construct better search and
  optimization algorithms for multiobjective problems.
\item Hyperheuristics -- algorithms that observe and react to perceived
  properties of a search space and adapt their behavior during the search
  accordingly.
\item Applied machine learning and data science for real-world applications.
\item Functional programming.
% \item Multi-task and multi-objective reinforcement learning. Much of my research
%   is focused on understanding the role of structure in inter-task relationships
%   and its effect on learning. 
% \item Learning classifier systems and automatic generalization in reinforcement
%   learning. I'm interested in how algorithms such as XCS can adaptively learn
%   appropriate levels of granularity in reinforcement learning systems, yielding
%   more efficient, accurate, and understandable policies.
\end{itemize}
